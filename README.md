# Assembly
A robust bi-directional algorithm for sorting written in Assembly. 

# bbsorer.c 
A function that doesn't take any parameters: Type long. In this function user can input any number of long integers using scanf. Then I return a pointer to the list with the number of items in the list inserted before the first long integer. User can end the input by typing anything other than a number.

# bbsorter.s
The assembly implementation of the sorting algorithm. Â
